DODGEBALL

Move the green ball to avoid the red balls for as long as possible.

This project is a work-in-progress. I am using it simply to gain a familiarity with iOS and Cocos2d frameworkds.

Important note: a slight but important modification was made to DrawingPrimitives.m, so anyone attempting to play the game without downloading the entire Cocos2d framework should make sure to replace this file.
